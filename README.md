## Requirements

This application uses Go modules, so you will require:

- [Go version 1.11+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- You will need require a [PAT from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

## Configuration

There are two aspects to configurating `hagen`.

### Environment variables

In order to connect to GitHub `hagen` requires two environment variables.

```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER=""
export GITHUB_TOKEN=""
```

The token can be generated by reading this [article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). Typically the `GITHUB_OWNER` will be your username.

### Configuration file

`hagen` tries to save on typing, so you can define some queries in a configuration file.

```yml
templates:
  sprint:
    query: "state:open project:acme/14"
    count: 200
  open-bugs:
    query: "repo:benmatselby/donny state:open"
    count: 50
```

To understand how to write the `query` section, follow [this article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

## Installation via Git

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benmatselby/hagen.git
cd hagen
make all
./hagen
```

You can also install into your `$GOPATH/bin` by `go install`
