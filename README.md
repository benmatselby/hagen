## Requirements

- [Go version 1.21+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- You will need require a [PAT from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

## Configuration

There are two aspects to configuring `hagen`.

### Environment variables

In order to connect to GitHub `hagen` requires three environment variables.

```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER=""  # This is likely to be your personal GitHub username
export GITHUB_ORG=""    # This is if you are linked to a GitHub org
export GITHUB_TOKEN=""  # Your PAT
```

The token can be generated by reading this [article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). Typically the `GITHUB_OWNER` will be your username.

### Configuration file

`hagen` tries to save on typing, so you can define some queries in a configuration file.

```yml
templates:
  sprint:
    query: "state:open project:acme/14"
    count: 200
  open-bugs:
    query: "repo:benmatselby/donny state:open"
    count: 50
```

To understand how to write the `query` section, follow [this article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

## Installation via Docker

Other than requiring [docker](http://docker.com) to be installed, there are no other requirements to run the application this way.

```shell
$ docker run \
  --rm \
  -t \
  -eGITHUB_ORG \
  -eGITHUB_OWNER \
  -eGITHUB_TOKEN \
  -v "${HOME}/.benmatselby":/root/.benmatselby \
  ghcr.io/benmatselby/hagen:latest [command]
```

The `latest` tag mentioned above can be changed to a released version. For all releases, see [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/benmatselby/hagen/tags). An example would then be:

## Installation via Git

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benmatselby/hagen.git
cd hagen
make all
./hagen
```

You can also install into your `$GOPATH/bin` by `go install`
